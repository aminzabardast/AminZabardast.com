    <h2>About this blog</h2>
    <p>
      I have <router-link to="/blog/2020/09/26/the-beginning">tried to make a habit of writing so many times</router-link> I've lost count of it.
      But I am resiliant.
      This blog is my latest - and hopefully last - attempt to become a regular writer.
      I like to write about many thing but it is too early to come up with any predictions.
      This will be updated.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate student who is trying to remain curious in a world filled with means of escapism.
      I like writing, reading books, and learning new things.
      I also quite enjoy reinventing the wheel if my goal is to learn about it.
