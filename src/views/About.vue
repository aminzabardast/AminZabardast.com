    <h2>About this blog</h2>
    <p>
      I have <router-link to="/blog/2020/09/26/the-beginning">tried to make a habit of writing</router-link> so many times I've lost count of it.
      But I am resilient.
      This blog is my latest - and hopefully last - attempt to become a writer who writes regularly.
      I like to write about many things but it is too early to commit to a fixed list.
      This will be updated.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate student who is trying to remain curious in a world filled with means of escapism.
      I like writing, reading books, and learning new things.
      I also quite enjoy reinventing the wheel.
      "Do not reinvent the wheel" is a terrible advice!
