# You do not need to be a developer to use Git

If you have ever worked on a project, an essay, or a thesis, then you have probably dealt with backups.
Many people keep multiple copies so they can track back their changes in case it is needed at some point.
But there should be a better way to do this, and there is! What they need is Git!

You may have already tried Git (pure Git, or through [Github](https://github.com/), or [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/)) and decided that it is confusing and you have given up. This is especially the case if you are not an avid terminal/command line user. That is the case for many of my friends. I have tried to push them towards using git, but what I have observed so far is that *Git is confusing*!

This was the case until last week in which I stumbled upon an interesting post.
Somebody had a brilliant idea on creating a small game that explains all the important parts of the Git with a hypothetical scenario.
It is called “[Oh My Git!](https://ohmygit.org/)”.
I did not need to try the game to know that this is a brilliant idea.
I have had the problem of prompting others to use the Git, and I have not been much successful.
Why didn’t I thought of this before!

I tried the game, and it did not disappoint!
The game-play is designed to resemble a simple card game.
This makes it more familiar to a wider range of people.
Each level is a certain concept you need to learn about using Git and you do not need to type any command to interact with the game.
It is just a drag and drop case with some typing.

You can earn an additional badge if you accomplish the level using the terminal/command line interface rather than the cards.
It is a nice little nudge to peak the user’s interest in using terminal/command line.

*The terminal/command line interface user badge will be awarded if you finish the level without using the cards.*

Are you motivated? The game is available for GNU/Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
*[Give Oh My Git!](https://ohmygit.org/)* a try and if you found it useful, spread the word!
