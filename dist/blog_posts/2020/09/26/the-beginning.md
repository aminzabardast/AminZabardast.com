For a graduate student who should be reading and composing articles like his life depends on it, I have had a tough time initiating a blog.
I always felt like I have a lot to share, and being a successful writer has always been so tantalizing.
However, putting pen to paper, or putting hands on the keyboard, does not come naturally.
Yet *nature* and *nurture* are two sides of the same coin.
For every natural writer, many relied on relentless practice.
So this lack of raw talent is not a good excuse.

As I am writing this public *declaration of interest* in writing, my mind is also racing.
Is it a smart decision?
Have I put enough toughs behind it?
What if I cannot keep up with it?
Shall I retreat and plan this more comprehensively?
Or maybe I should stop right now and spare myself the misery?
What am I going to write about anyway?
Is it going to be formal? Or maybe casual.
So far, I have been indecisive, but I am determined to enjoy the journey.

All the answers are behind the fog of the future, and at this state, speculation is not helpful.
It is time to act, observe, analyze, and optimize.
